* Learn how current tests work
    * Change the test expect WOODSTOCK instead of SNOOPY, watch it fail
    -> Is the current implementation for the test good? Is is easy to change the expectation?
    * Change the code to display WOODSTOCK instead of SNOOPY, watch it fail (hint, it's defined in qml)
    * Change the feature about Snoopy dying. It should display "0" When Snoopy has died 3 times.(Only 4th death will restart).
    -> Implement the change in code! Easy? Hard? Did the Cucumber test help to verify it?

* Create new examples (scenarios) for existing features
    * The startupscreen should display text "Hit any key to start" on capitals
    * Create scenario for jumping, implement necessary step definitions.

* Create tests for unimplemented feature
    * Display timer which will run until player has finished all levels
    * When player dies for the last time, highscore should be listed
